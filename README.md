# ProjectRunningFox

Project Running Fox is a application made for quick modifications for a handful of PS3 Games. It requires a Jailbroken PS3 running either DEX or CEX firmware with the support of TMAPI (Target Manager API) or CCAPI (Control Console API). 


HOW IT WAS MADE

Project Running Fox was made solely by me (Brandon) using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate along with Devexpress DevComponets 14.2. The PS3LIB library by iMCSx was also used in order to Write Memory to the Target Playstation 3 Game.

- Call of Duty: MW2
- Call of Duty: Mw3
- Call of Duty: Black Ops
- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

IMPORTANT DETAILS

Project Running Fox is still subject to updates. (As of now Project Running Fox has been downloaded only 300+ times)
Game Memory Offsets and Addresses were either found on NextGenUpdate, updated my be, or found by me.(Give Credit)
DevExpress is required to open the source (If you dont know what DevExpress is dont bother asking me for help)
DO NOT STEAL THIS AND MAKE IT YOUR OWN!! MAKE SOMETHING UNIQUE! If I see people doing this I will remove this and nobody else
will be able to learn from it!

*I am releasing this becuase of the lack of downloads. I am done with PS3 projects becuase people would rather use mod menus 
than Real Time Modding Tools. And PS3 is old i am going to work on different things.
